## Akka.Cluster.Discovery

Common libraries, that allows to manage a set of Akka.NET cluster seed nodes using a provided 3rd party service.

Current status:

- [ ] Lockfile (dev only)
- [x] Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Consul
- [ ] Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Etcd
- [x] Akka.Cluster.Discovery.KubernetesApi
- [ ] Akka.Cluster.Discovery.ServiceFabric
- [ ] Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Zookeeper

### Example

This example uses [Consul](https://www.consul.io/) for cluster seed node discovery.

```csharp
using System;
using Akka.Actor;
using Akka.Configuration;
using Akka.Cluster.Discovery;

var config = ConfigurationFactory.Parse(@"
  akka {
    actor.provider = cluster
    cluster.discovery {
      provider = akka.cluster.discovery.consul
      consul {
        listener-url = ""http://127.0.0.1:8500""
        class = ""Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Consul.ConsulDiscoveryService, Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Consul""
      }
    }
}");

using (var system = ActorSystem.Create())
{
	// this line triggers discovery service initialization
	// and will join or initialize current actor system to the cluster
	await ClusterDiscovery.JoinAsync(system);

	Console.ReadLine();
}
```

This example uses [Kubernetes API](https://github.com/kubernetes-client/csharp) for cluster seed node discovery.

```csharp
var myPodIp = GetLocalIPAddress();

var config = ConfigurationFactory.ParseString(@"
  akka {
    actor.provider = cluster
    remote.dot-netty.tcp {
      hostname = """ + myPodIp + @"""
      port = 2551 
    }
    cluster.roles = [sample,demo]
    cluster.discovery {
      provider = akka.cluster.discovery.k8s
      k8s {
        refresh-interval = 10s
        namespace = ""default""
        label-selector = ""akka-cluster=sample,env=Development""
      }
    }
}");

using var system = ActorSystem.Create("sample", config);
await ClusterDiscovery.JoinAsync(system);

using (var system = ActorSystem.Create())
{
	// this line triggers discovery service initialization
	// and will join or initialize current actor system to the cluster
	await ClusterDiscovery.JoinAsync(system);

	Console.ReadLine();
}
```

By default, the discovery plugin will look for all pods with a label "akka-cluster" matching the name of the actor system.
You can override the label selector in the hocon file to any valid Kubernetes label selector instead.

Because we cannot determine the Akka cluster port based on the Kubernetes API alone, the port for each pod must be specific (i.e. no using port zero to get a random port).
By default, the plugin will assume all other pods use the same port as the local one, but will in fact look for an override each pod's annotations under the key "akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp.port".
If you have multiple applications running in the same cluster, running on different ports, you can simply annotate each deployment with the application's port.

Example:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: sampleapp
  labels:
    app: sampleapp
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: sampleapp
  replicas: 6
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: sampleapp
        akka-cluster: sample
        env: Development
      annotations:
        akka.remote.dot-netty.tcp.port: "2551"
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: sampleapp
        image: sampleapp:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 2551
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 256Mi
            cpu: "250m"
          requests:
            memory: 128Mi
            cpu: "80m"
```

By using a self-discovering label selector (i.e. a label selector that finds that app itself), no Lighthouse is needed.
There are benefits to running Lighthouse, though. And if you wish to use a specific split-brain resolver in Lighthouse, you can 
deploy Lighthouse as a Deployment rather than a StatefulSet, and let it self-discover (i.e. use a label that selects the 
lighthouse pods), and then deploy your other applications with a label selector that will discover only the Lighthouse pods, rather than themselves.

## Configuration

```hocon
# Cluster discovery namespace
  akka.cluster.discovery {
	
	# Path to a provider configuration used in for cluster discovery.
	# Example:
	# 1. akka.cluster.discovery.consul
	provider = "akka.cluster.discovery.k8s"

	# A configuration used by consul based discovery service
	consul {
		
		# A fully qualified type name with assembly name of a discovery service class 
		# used by the cluster discovery plugin.
		class = "Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Consul.ConsulDiscoveryService, Akka.Cluster.Discovery.Consul"

		# Define a dispatcher type used by discovery service actor.
		dispatcher = "akka.actor.default-dispatcher"

		# Time interval in which a `alive` signal will be send by a discovery service
		# to fit the external service TTL (time to live) expectations. 
		alive-interval = 5s

		# Time to live given for a discovery service to be correctly acknowledged as
		# alive by external monitoring service. It must be higher than `alive-interval`. 
		alive-timeout = 1m

		# Interval in which current cluster node will reach for a discovery service
		# to retrieve data about registered node updates. Nodes, that have been detected
		# as "lost" from service discovery provider, will be downed and removed from the cluster. 
		refresh-interval = 1m

		# Maximum number of retries given for a discovery service to register itself
		# inside 3rd party provider before hitting hard failure. 
		join-retries = 3

		# In case if lock-based discovery service won't be able to acquire the lock,
		# it will retry to do it again after some time, max up to the number of times 
		# described by `join-retries` setting value.
		lock-retry-interval = 250ms

		# An URL address on with Consul listener service can be found.
		listener-url = "http://127.0.0.1:8500"

		# A Consul datacenter.
		datacenter = ""

		# A Consul token.
		token = ""
		
		# A timeout configured for consul to mark a time to live given for a node
		# before it will be marked as unhealthy. Must be greater than `alive-interval` and less than `alive-timeout`.
		service-check-ttl = 15s

		# Timeout for a Consul client connection requests.
		#wait-time = <optional value>
		
		# An interval in which consul client will be triggered for periodic restarts. 
		# If not provided or 0, client will never be restarted. 
		#restart-interval = 0s
	}

	# A configuration used by Kubernetes API based discovery service
	k8s {
		# A fully qualified type name with assembly name of a discovery service class 
		# used by the cluster discovery plugin.
		class = "Akka.Cluster.Discovery.KubernetesApi.KubernetesDiscoveryService, Akka.Cluster.Discovery.KubernetesApi"

		# Define a dispatcher type used by discovery service actor.
		dispatcher = "akka.actor.default-dispatcher"

		# Time interval in which a `alive` signal will be send by a discovery service
		# to fit the external service TTL (time to live) expectations. 
		alive-interval = 5s

		# Time to live given for a discovery service to be correctly acknowledged as
		# alive by external monitoring service. It must be higher than `alive-interval`. 
		alive-timeout = 1m

		# Interval in which current cluster node will reach for a discovery service
		# to retrieve data about registered node updates. Nodes, that have been detected
		# as "lost" from service discovery provider, will be downed and removed from the cluster. 
		refresh-interval = 1m

		# Maximum number of retries given for a discovery service to register itself
		# inside 3rd party provider before hitting hard failure. 
		join-retries = 3

		# Kubernetes namespace to search for pods
		namespace = "default"

		# An optional label selector to override default pod selection
		label-selector = ""
	}
}
```

### Plans for the future

- Implement missing extensions.
- Limit configuration capabilities based on roles (so that only subset of actor system may be used as seed nodes).
- Take into account actor system restarts (change of the corresponding unique address id).
